                    <h2>Online gaming is an enormous industry that grows each year. 
                        As the audience for online multiplayer games has gotten bigger, 
                        the technology to meaningfully match these players has lagged behind. 
                        Often times players, especially in competitive settings, are matched 
                        using game metrics and statistics in order to have players of a similar 
                        skill caliber play together. As this has become commonplace, players find 
                        themselves matched with people who appear only as a username. With a lack 
                        of personal connection, some players engage in negative communication which 
                        results in a lower quality gaming experience for all.</h2>

                    <h2>This web application aims to resolve existing matchmaking issues by matching 
                        players on criteria beyond simply skill. It collects more 
                        information about a player, including parameters related to play-style, preferences 
                        and attitude. Thus, it will reintroduce a human component to online teammates and 
                        help to brighten a gamerâ€™s horizon with improved gaming experiences. Taking data 
                        from in-game sources and crossing it with player and user generated behavior profiles, 
                        your prospect system should match players with teammates that suit both their skill 
                        and behavior. In addition, it enables users to find players from other 
                        games, add them as friends, and form groups; all with like-minded players that they find in matchmaking.</h2>
